Hi, my name is Martin Zhao. I am a 1st year Computer Science Student at the University of Waterloo!

Currently, I am focusing on learning Python and MySQL. Other languages I have utilized include Java, C, C++, Racket, LaTeX, and Bash.

I am proficient in Excel, PowerPoint, Autodesk Inventor, and other 3D editing and printing software.

Having used many other coding languages and physics software, I am adaptable and accepting of any challenge.
